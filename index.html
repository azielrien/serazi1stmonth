<h2 id="gallery">10 Reasons Aziel Loves Seraphina</h2>
<section class="gallery">
  <!-- 1 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:-6deg" data-note="Noodles and noodles — Sera and Zizi finally had noodles together!\n\nThat day, Zizi only remembered to take a photo of Sera eating, because she looked so adorably focused. Zizi kind of wished she could become the noodle bowl in Sera’s hands, just so Sera could be happy eating noodles and Zizi could be the one holding her joy."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ir7U1la.jpg" alt="1"></div>
  <!-- 2 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:5deg" data-note="Zizi always thinks Sera is the cutest when Sera says she wants to eat chocolate bread. That’s make aziel realised how much she loves it.\n\n zizi sometimes wishes he could become chocolate… just to make Sera full and smiling every single day"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QluV8U5.jpg" alt="2"></div>
  <!-- 3 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:-4deg" data-note="Sera has always thought bunnies are the cutest. She completely loses track of time when she’s watching videos of angry bunnies—and she always showing how even when they’re mad, they’re still the most adorable things ever, but for Zizi, it’s always been Sera who’s the cutest, more than any bunny she’s ever shown.\n\n Sera always brushes it off with a “whatever,” but Zizi knows better. That little flush on her cheeks gives her away every time, and it only makes her look even cuter. Zizi loves her, truly."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M0bDC5k.jpg" alt="3"></div>
  <!-- 4 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:7deg" data-note="Taking a night walk with Sera while she was going through something tough was a new experience for Zizi. It was the first time Zizi had seen this side of her—even though Sera kept saying she was fine and telling Zizi the entire plot of Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus in full detail. \n\n That night, Zizi quietly made a promise to himself, he would always do her best to make Sera feel safe, happy, and forget her bad days a little faster."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NyaWDx3.jpg" alt="4"></div>
  <!-- 5 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:-3deg" data-note="Sera being serious is the one thing that makes Zizi scratch her head.He means....they’re usually all jokes but when Sera turns serious, Zizi honestly finds it... kind of sexy. Like, seriously sexy. \n\n It makes him want to keep Sera just so he can tease her nonstop…until things escalate into a brutally kiss (sera knows what it means)."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xnkXFGN.jpg" alt="5"></div>
  <!-- 6 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:4deg" data-note="Besides chocolate bread, Sera also loves drinking chocolate milk. Sometimes, Zizi thinks... maybe Sera is chocolate in human form. Honestly? Zizi’s convinced that if she could ever take a bite out of Sera, she’d taste like chocolate. It’s such a silly thought that Zizi ends up laughing to himself whenever it crosses his mind. But then again… maybe it’s true? Falling for Sera feels just like chocolate that seet and intoxicating.One bite would never be enough."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yBOnKOe.jpg" alt="6"></div>
  <!-- 7 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:2deg" data-note="Sera always says, “why you always saying I'm cute” Sera just don't understand that sera is everything to zizi's eyes. Not because of how she looks, or the way she talks (though that’s adorable too) but because of how she shows up gently yet always managing to make Zizi feel safe, like a warm hug on a rainy day. \n\n ps. Eventhough sera looking just wake up from a nap and eat immediately, of course."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0M8S8CQ.jpg" alt="7"></div>
  <!-- 8 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:-5deg" data-note="Sometimes Zizi wonders, how can one person have that much of an effect? One message about sera showing her cute plushies can make zizi long, exhausting day feel light again."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/K3AL9k2.jpg" alt="8"></div>
  <!-- 9 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:6deg" data-note="Zizi never really says it out loud, but if she’s being honest:\n\n He wants to be everything for Sera. Someone to talk to, someone to come home to… even someone to cry with, if needed. Because since meeting Sera, looking the way she shines throughly in their days spent, zizi feel at ease."><img src="https://i.imgur.com/WcM6fut.jpg" alt="9"></div>
  <!-- 10 -->
  <div class="card" style="--angle:-2deg" data-note="Lastly, There’s something about Sera’s playful charm—the way she teases so effortlessly, all giggles and sparkly eyes, that drives Zizi crazy in the best way. It’s cute, yes, but it also makes Zizi want to wrap her up and hide her from the rest of the world. Because how could anyone be this effortlessly soft and radiant, and not have everyone trying to get close?"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/jCsyPw8.jpg" alt="10"></div>
